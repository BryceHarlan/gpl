I walked into my local BB with a list of computer components for a PC I am building (I was purchasing from New Egg and Best Buy).  Wandered around and an employee saw me (he ended up being the manager), and he helped me put together an order, not only that but he checked New Egg to make sure I was getting competitive prices, not only that but he made sure I was getting free shipping.  On top of that he went through my New Egg list and price matched anything they had.  Now I only need a couple more things from New Egg.  Thought I'd share.", "title": "", "_id": "523755"}
{"text": "Group RESPs are a bit like a true mutual insurance company. You all pay into the fund, and then, depending on the number of kids that are in school that particular year, you get paid a certain amount. Advantages could be that if you end up with one or two years of only your kid in school and nobody else's in that age bracket, you get more money. Disadvantage for the same-reverse reason also could be true. Another advantage of regular programs, unlike pooled, is that if you do not use all the money, then some/all of the remaining funds may be transferable to an RRSP. Personally I would not invest in one, unless it was more like a specific investment-club that I knew everybody.", "title": "", "_id": "122794"}
{"text": "Mutual funds buy (and sell) shares in companies in accordance with  the policies set forth in their prospectus, not according to the  individual needs of an investor, that is, when you invest money in (or withdraw money from) a mutual fund,  the manager buys or sells whatever shares that, in the manager's judgement,  will be the most appropriate ones (consistent with the investment policies). Thus, a large-cap mutual fund manager will not buy the latest hot small-cap stock that will likely be hugely profitable; he/she must choose only between various large capitalization companies. Some exchange-traded funds are fixed baskets of stocks. Suppose you will not invest in a company X as a matter of principle. Unless a mutual fund prospectus says that it will not invest in X, you may well end up having an investment in X at some time because the fund manager bought shares in X. With such an ETF,  you know what is in the basket, and if the basket does not include stock in X  now, it will not own stock in X at a later date. Some exchange-traded funds are constructed based on some index and track the index as a matter of policy. Thus, you will not be investing in X unless X becomes part of the index because Standard or Poor or Russell or somebody changed their minds, and the ETF buys X in order to track the index. Finally, some ETFs are exactly like general mutual funds except that you can buy or sell ETF shares at any time at the price at the instant that your order is executed whereas with mutual funds, the price of the mutual fund shares that you have bought or sold is the NAV of the mutual fund shares for that day, which is established based on the closing prices at the end of the trading day of the stocks, bonds etc that the fund owns.  So, you might end up owning stock in X at any time based on what the fund manager thinks about X.", "title": "", "_id": "479420"}
{"text": "You're going to find a lot of conflicting or vague answers on the internet because there are a lot of plan design elements that are set by the plan sponsor (employer).  There are laws that mandate certain elements and dictate certain requirements of plan sponsors, many of these laws are related to record keeping and fiduciary duty.  There is a lot of latitude for plan sponsors to allow or restrict employee actions even if there is no law against that activity.   There are different rules mandated for employee pre-tax contributions, employee post-tax contributions, and employer contributions.  You have more flexibility with regard to the employer contributions and any post tax contributions you may have made; your plan may allow an in-service distribution of those two items before you reach age 59.5. While your HR department (like most -all- HR departments) is not staffed with ERISA attorneys and CPAs it is your HR department and applicable plan documents that will lay out what an employee is permitted to do under the plan.", "title": "", "_id": "585889"}
